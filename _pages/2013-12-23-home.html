Hey guys, this is my Fourth year blog.

I'm aiming to create an iOS port of Age of Empires - Crazy huge I know its unlikely to hit full scope but theres something alluring about attacking a huge project.

My reasoning behind remaking this game is: I want to justify mobile as a decent platform for modern gaming, RTS and RPGs are ideal for this platform but console and PC is still the main platform. I decided that using a game that is already considered great and adapting it to work well for mobile is the best way to justify the platform, HCI is everything.
